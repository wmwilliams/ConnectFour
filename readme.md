I definitely didnt plan out how i was going to set up the board when i started. At first it was a table, then a bunch of divs, and finally a number of ul's. But the spacing and responsiveness isnt great. If i had more time I think using a table was the best way to go. Everything is functional, although I would like to adjust the local storage to include the users past names as well as their past scores.
